# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

## this contains my custom bash terminal
install is simplified through my makefile
simply type make linux to create my custom bash

make clean will clean your bash back to its original state.

this makefile will run a clean script to reset your bash and vim
then run a script file called linux.sh that will load my custom alias and vim preferences
